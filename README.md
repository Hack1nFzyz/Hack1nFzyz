## Contributing

### Option 1: Submit via GitHub Issue (recommended)

It is strongly encouraged to submit bug reports and feature requests through [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jerryc05/fzyz-app/issues) page. It will help me organize and keep track of every issue reported.

**IMPORTANT!!!** Do not use issue pages in Tencent Dev. It's painful to maintain more than one issue page sitess, and I will ignore those issues 99.999% of times.

### Option 2: Contact Me via Direct Message Apps

If we knew each other, it's fine. Otherwise, don't.
